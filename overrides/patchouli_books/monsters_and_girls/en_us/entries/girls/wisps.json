Though their appearance would lead one to believe they might be female, none of them show any signs of either sex, but they all seem very kindhearted! They like collecting gems, but they love snacking on gold. Perhaps I shouldn't take them to the Bastions... They also seem to have a destain for undead creatures, even going out of their way to attack Phantoms and Vexes, maybe they have some relation to the mythical creature known as an \"Allay\", though more research is needed to prove anything."
