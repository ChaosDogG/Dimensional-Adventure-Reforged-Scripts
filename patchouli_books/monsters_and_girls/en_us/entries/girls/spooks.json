Breaking them spawns loot sometimes, but other times it'll spawn Silverfish or even some of these Spooks. I've noticed the spooks are completely immune to conventional damage types, only being affected by potions of healing. Mayhaps this is due to the fact that they are undead. They also seem to like Spectral Cakes...ghosts like cakes?!"
